# Book-Shop-Inventory-System
Actually it was my university course's project. It shows all the avaliable books in the shop. It has two interfaces,User and Admin interface.
In Admine Interface, it allows the admins to update and delete a book name through after providing correct username and password.
In User Interface, it allows the user to just see the avaliable books in the shop.
